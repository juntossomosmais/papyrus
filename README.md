# Base Template

This is a very simple template for a new repository. Once created make sure that your new repository has:

- A well written `README.md` file: the README should describe the project and have all the instructions required for a newcomer to get started and run the code. Keep in mind that the README should be always updated.
- About:
    - Description: it's great to have a nice and short description on the `About` part of the repository.
    - Topics: topics make it easy to other peouple find the repository.
- If the repository is public don't forget to add a `LICENCE` file.
